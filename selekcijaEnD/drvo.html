		<h2>Biomass is a basic term in ecology, and in the energy production industry</h2>

		<p>Organic waste such as dead plant and animal material, animal dung and kitchen waste can be converted into gaseous fuel called biogas. 
		The organic waste is decomposed by bacteria in biogas digesters to emit biogas which is essentially a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide. 
		Biomass is part of the carbon cycle. Photosynthesis converts carbon from the atmosphere into plant matter. 
		When the plant rots or burns, the carbon goes back into the atmosphere. 
		This happens somewhat quickly, and plant matter used as a fuel can be constantly replaced by planting for new growth. 
		Therefore, it doesn't much change the amount of atmospheric carbon.</p>

		<p> In the energy industry, it refers to biological material which can be used as fuel or for industrial production. 
		Biomass includes plant matter grown for use as biofuel, and also includes plant or animal matter used for production of fibres, chemicals or heat. 
		Biomass may also include biodegradable wastes which can be burnt as fuel. 
		It excludes organic material which has been transformed by geological processes into substances such as coal or petroleum. 
		It is usually measured by dry weight.</p>

		<p>Biomass is grown from several plants, including switchgrass, hemp, corn, poplar, willow and sugarcane. 
		The particular plant used is usually not very important to the end products, but it does affect the processing of the raw material. 
		Though biomass is a renewable fuel, its use can still contribute to global warming. This happens when the natural carbon equilibrium is disturbed.</p>
