		<h2>Solar energy is the energy that is in sunlight</h2>

		<p>It has been used for thousands of years in many different ways by people all over the world. 
		As well as its traditional human uses in heating, cooking, and drying, 
		it is used today to make electricity where other power supplies are absent, such as in remote places and in space. 
		It is becoming cheaper to make electricity from solar energy and in many situations it is now competitive with energy from coal or oil. 
		A solar cooker can be used for cooking food.</p>

		<p>After passing through the Earth's atmosphere, most of the Sun's energy is in the form of visible light and infrared light radiation. 
		Plants convert the energy in sunlight into chemical energy (sugars and starches) through the process of photosynthesis. 
		Humans regularly use this store of energy in various ways, as when they burn wood or fossil fuels, or when simply eating plants, fish and animals.
		Solar radiation reaches the Earth's upper Earth's atmosphere with the power of 1366 W/m2. 
		At present, solar cell panels convert, at best, about 15% of sunlight hitting them into electricity.</p>

		<p>Solar panels get energy from the sun for people to use. 
		There are two types of solar panels, those that collect heat (thermal), and those that produce electricity (photovoltaic). 
		Heat from solar panels is often used for space heating and for hot water.
		Solar panels collect renewable energy. In the 20th century some used the heat of the sun to make steam for a steam engine to turn a generator. 
		Nowadays producing electricity from the sun's light is cheaper. This is a solid state way of producing electricity, meaning that it has no moving parts.</p>
